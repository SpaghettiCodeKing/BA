## Project for the VRDU experiment

### Description
This project is designed to conduct experiments for Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU). It provides a framework for preparing data, running extraction workflows, and evaluating results. The experiment includes support for handling Latin layouts in prompt.

### Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure the following:
**Data Acquisition:**
Download the required dataset:
- From Google Drive (insert link).
- Or from Kaggle (insert link).

### How to run
To run the application follow these steps:

-**Preparation:** Navigate to the "jupiter notebooks" folder. Start with the preparation.ipynb notebook and follow the step-by-step instructions provided within it.
- **Extraction:** TExecute the desired Jupyter Notebooks for performing the document extractions. Detailed instructions are included in each notebook to guide you.
- **Evaluate Results:** Use the evaluation notebooks to assess the effectiveness of the extractions. Follow the notes provided in these notebooks for a smooth experience.

The code for making the latin layouts of the prompts was used from
